# Samir Gupta

 

1) To run the code for this project I have created 2 files for users to easily run everything: .bat for windows users and shell script for linux users. (inside folder py_files) 

Note: The only change the user needs to do for running the two files is change the path to the path where the py_files repo are stored. 

2) The data for this project needs to be store in the data folder provided in this github repo. The data is private please reach out to me on samir.a.gupta@vanderbilt.edu to get access to the data.

3) All of the required plots for this project will be created in the plots folder inside py_files folder.

### Windows Users: 

.\python_run.bat

### Linux Users: 

chmod +x python_run.sh
